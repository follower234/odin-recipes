        <li>3 cups of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir the ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and eggs in a medium bowl and set it aside.  Season the beef as desired.  In a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the beef until it's well browned, stirring often to break up the meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the sauce in the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Spoon 2 cups beef mixture into a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Top with 4 lasagna noodles, half the ricotta cheese mixture and half the mozzarella. Repeat the layers. Top with the remaining 4 lasagna noodles, remaining beef mixture and the remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400Â°F. for 30 minutes or until the lasagna is hot. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
